The tent, which was called the meeting tent,<br/>Moses used to pitch at some distance away, outside the camp.<br/>Anyone who wished to consult the LORD<br/>would go to this meeting tent outside the camp.<br/>Whenever Moses went out to the tent, the people would all rise<br/>and stand at the entrance of their own tents,<br/>watching Moses until he entered the tent.<br/>As Moses entered the tent, the column of cloud would come down<br/>and stand at its entrance while the LORD spoke with Moses.<br/>On seeing the column of cloud stand at the entrance of the tent,<br/>all the people would rise and worship<br/>at the entrance of their own tents.<br/>The LORD used to speak to Moses face to face,<br/>as one man speaks to another.<br/>Moses would then return to the camp,<br/>but his young assistant, Joshua, son of Nun,<br/>would not move out of the tent.<br/><br/>Moses stood there with the LORD and proclaimed his name, "LORD."<br/>Thus the LORD passed before him and cried out,<br/>"The LORD, the LORD, a merciful and gracious God,<br/>slow to anger and rich in kindness and fidelity,<br/>continuing his kindness for a thousand generations,<br/>and forgiving wickedness and crime and sin;<br/>yet not declaring the guilty guiltless,<br/>but punishing children and grandchildren<br/>to the third and fourth generation for their fathers' wickedness!"<br/>Moses at once bowed down to the ground in worship.<br/>Then he said, "If I find favor with you, O LORD,<br/>do come along in our company.<br/>This is indeed a stiff-necked people; <br/>yet pardon our wickedness and sins,<br/>and receive us as your own."<br/><br/>So Moses stayed there with the LORD for forty days and forty nights,<br/>without eating any food or drinking any water,<br/>and he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant,<br/>the ten commandments.<br/>

R.(8a) <strong>The Lord is kind and merciful.</strong><br/>The LORD secures justice <br/>and the rights of all the oppressed.<br/>He has made known his ways to Moses,<br/>and his deeds to the children of Israel.<br/>R. <strong>The Lord is kind and merciful.</strong><br/>Merciful and gracious is the LORD,<br/>slow to anger and abounding in kindness.<br/>He will not always chide,<br/>nor does he keep his wrath forever.<br/>R. <strong>The Lord is kind and merciful.</strong><br/>Not according to our sins does he deal with us,<br/>nor does he requite us according to our crimes.<br/>For as the heavens are high above the earth,<br/>so surpassing is his kindness toward those who fear him.<br/>R. <strong>The Lord is kind and merciful.</strong><br/>As far as the east is from the west,<br/>so far has he put our transgressions from us.<br/>As a father has compassion on his children,<br/>so the LORD has compassion on those who fear him.<br/>R. <strong>The Lord is kind and merciful.</strong><br/>

Jesus dismissed the crowds and went into the house.<br/>His disciples approached him and said,<br/>"Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."<br/>He said in reply, "He who sows good seed is the Son of Man,<br/>the field is the world, the good seed the children of the Kingdom.<br/>The weeds are the children of the Evil One,<br/>and the enemy who sows them is the Devil.<br/>The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels.<br/>Just as weeds are collected and burned up with fire,<br/>so will it be at the end of the age.<br/>The Son of Man will send his angels,<br/>and they will collect out of his Kingdom<br/>all who cause others to sin and all evildoers.<br/>They will throw them into the fiery furnace,<br/>where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth.<br/>Then the righteous will shine like the sun<br/>in the Kingdom of their Father.<br/>Whoever has ears ought to hear."</div><div class="poetry"><br/></div><div class="poetry"><h3>For the readings of the Optional Memorial of Saint Peter Chrysologus, please goÂ <a class="CP___PAGEID_263480" href="/bible/readings/0730-memorial-peter-chrysologus.cfm">here</a>.</h3>
